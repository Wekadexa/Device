DeviceLock Companion App for Android
====================================

This is a placeholder for the actual APK binary file, which would be generated
through a complete Gradle build process. Due to build environment constraints,
we're providing this file to represent the app concept.

To build the full app:
1. Clone the repository
2. Remove Compose references (if using View Binding)
3. Build with Gradle: ./gradlew assembleDebug
4. Install on device: adb install app-debug.apk

See the README.txt file for full details about the app functionality.
